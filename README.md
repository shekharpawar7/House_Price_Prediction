# House Price Prediction

House price prediction is a crucial process that involves leveraging statistical and machine learning techniques to estimate the future value of residential properties. This repository contains files related to a machine learning project for predicting house prices, providing valuable insights for real estate professionals, homeowners, and investors.

## Key Aspects of House Price Prediction

1. **Data Collection:**
   - Gathered relevant data, including historical property prices, location details, property size, number of bedrooms and bathrooms, amenities, and other features.

2. **Data Cleaning and Preprocessing:**
   - Addressed errors, missing values, and inconsistencies in raw data.
   - Normalized, scaled, and transformed variables to ensure the quality of the dataset.

3. **Feature Selection:**
   - Identified influential features to reduce dimensionality and enhance the efficiency of the predictive model.

4. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**
   - Analyzed and visualized data to gain insights into relationships between features and the target variable (house prices).

5. **Model Selection:**
   - Chose an appropriate machine learning model based on the characteristics of the dataset. Common models include linear regression, decision trees, random forests, support vector machines, and neural networks.

6. **Model Training:**
   - Utilized historical data to train the selected model, allowing it to learn patterns and relationships within the data.

7. **Model Evaluation:**
   - Assessed model performance using metrics such as Mean Squared Error (MSE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), or Mean Absolute Error (MAE) to determine generalization to unseen data.

8. **Validation and Testing:**
   - Validated the model on a separate dataset to ensure robust performance on unseen data.

9. **Deployment:**
    - Deployed the model for real-world predictions, potentially integrating it into web applications by using flask.
